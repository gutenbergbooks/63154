These are chiefly songs of women's work, but there
is a Christmas song for soldiers.  The music of life is
stilled to-day.  Only the bugle note is heard.  To the men
in the trenches it means action, organized and perfected;
to us at home it repeats the call.  These songs are bound
in crimson for that is the colour of courage; and in gold
which signifies the strength and the joy of life which is work.

<h3>
  THE VISION<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A soldier's soul returns the centuries down&mdash;<br />
  Radiance again!  Love's gleaming mystic mate,<br />
  She who was burned for witchcraft and for state<br />
  In the old market-place of Rouen town.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To-day I met her spirit on the Earth,<br />
  And felt a joyous light dark spaces fill;<br />
  I knew this troubled planet called her still<br />
  Upon the wheel of reincarnate birth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Behold a legion of all-souls," she said,<br />
  "Who ride again for country and for King,<br />
  And with them, as the ardent sun with spring,<br />
  See the enchanted ones that life calls dead."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Woman and man, renewing faith's old tryst,<br />
  Breast, shuddering, the deeps of this last war,<br />
  And high above them gleams the stranger-star,<br />
  Silver in blood-red skies&mdash;the grail of Christ."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O you who see a vision in the night,<br />
  And you who ride high-hearted, woman-man,<br />
  I call you by the name of The New Joan."<br />
  So passed she, clad in armour, clad in light.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="child"></a>
  I<br />
<br />
  THE CHILD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Give me a new soul, God of all things free,<br />
  Help me to dream the golden dream of youth,<br />
  Till gazing deep into the eyes of Truth<br />
  The dream returns in life that is to be.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With Thee I breathe a fire most strange and bright,<br />
  Rosy as dawning, jubilant as day,<br />
  A light eternal on the time-worn way,<br />
  A morning note to stir the ag√®d night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To sing the song of flower-time again<br />
  It is to deck with joy an ancient door,&mdash;<br />
  A fresh rose, cosmic of each rose before,<br />
  To link with wonder in the endless chain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And as they play mid stars or 'neath the sun<br />
  I ask a song for children everywhere,<br />
  A gleam that dances with them unaware<br />
  Since God, and they, and joy, are wholly One.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="law"></a>
  II<br />
<br />
  THE LAW<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  If Law be given my hand to make<br />
  I pray Thee, Lord, that I may break<br />
  The old Law, resolute and hard<br />
  And fickle as a chance-thrown card.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And ere I lay me down to sleep<br />
  I pray Thee, Lord, new Law to keep,<br />
  Great statutes made of Love and Pain,<br />
  Beauty of Sorrow born again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For I would find out Truth, my Lord,<br />
  The soul behind the naked word,<br />
  And at the bourne where life began<br />
  I would inquire the law for man.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Perhaps a Voice may answer me<br />
  That until man in woman be,<br />
  Woman in man, the two in one,<br />
  The latter days have not begun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The woman-will of man a part,<br />
  The more-of-man in woman's heart,<br />
  From that great marriage pure of flaw<br />
  May spring the Everlasting Law.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

  III<br />
<br />
  THE KITCHEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Whoever makes a thing more bright<br />
  He is an angel of all light</i>"<br />
  So I, with every skill I can,<br />
  Return to use of pot and pan.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Retrieve must I the ages' waste,<br />
  And learn that what the years call 'Taste,'<br />
  Is Hunger's sated brother, Sin.<br />
  Lo, I shall dwell where Truths begin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A kingdom enter, ancient, dear,<br />
  Where red Fire lives, and Plenties are,<br />
  Where Order summoned back to me<br />
  Makes Labor sing, makes Beauty free.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So shall I take the golden wheat<br />
  And make me loaves for men to eat;<br />
  For I am Joan, whose pure desire<br />
  Still keeps aflame the household fire.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<br />
  THE LAND<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I am back on the land of my fathers,<br />
  And I tread it with double-soled boots,<br />
  I hoe it with hands that are toil-worn<br />
  Wearing joyful and picturesque suits.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I am clad, head to foot, in dull khaki<br />
  That echoes my good mother&mdash;Earth,<br />
  And I'm glad that my profile is "boyish,"<br />
  That my "song" is a whistle of mirth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I can cut and convey to my cabin<br />
  These logs that I need for the fire,<br />
  And I hail the concern of each slacker<br />
  Who is ribald anent my attire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I am doing his bit, though he lingers.<br />
  I am Joan&mdash;and not Peter Pan.<br />
  Yet the vision that glows through my working<br />
  Is the love that I bear to one man.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

  THE BATTLEFIELD*<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  *This poem first appeared as "Grey-Knitting."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Something sings gently through the din of battle,<br />
  Something spreads very softly rim on rim<br />
  And every soldier hears, at times, a murmur<br />
  Tender, incessant,&mdash;dim.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A tiny click of little wooden needles,<br />
  Elfin amid the gianthood of war;<br />
  Whispers of women, tireless and patient,<br />
  Who weave the web afar.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whispers of women, tireless and patient,<br />
  "This is our heart's love," it would seem to say,<br />
  "Wrought with the ancient tools of our vocation,<br />
  Weave we the web of love from day to day."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so each soldier, laughing, fighting,&mdash;dying<br />
  Under the alien skies, in his great hour,<br />
  May listen, in death's prescience all-enfolding,<br />
  And hear a fairy sound bloom like a flower&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I like to think that soldiers, gaily dying<br />
  For the white Christ on fields with shame sown deep,<br />
  May hear the tender song of women's needles,<br />
  As they fall fast asleep.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="world"></a>

<br />
  THE WORLD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  It is a new world that my feet must tread,<br />
  New, though the hurrying ages call it old,<br />
  While fields that yesterday were cloth-of-gold<br />
  Are all dissolving, like a film half-fled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The wondrous 'stage' of life, its mimic joys;<br />
  The deft accomplishment, the bubble fame;<br />
  Statecraft bedecked as a career, a name;<br />
  Art as a servitor that wealth employs&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These were the worlds our mothers counted new,<br />
  These were the ways we still had kept our own,<br />
  Until Eternal Law from His high throne<br />
  Melted our world in sudden fire, and dew.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now through mists of dew, through leaping flame<br />
  We ride again upon an ancient quest,<br />
  That we may bring Love home, no longer guest<br />
  But Love Triumphant, ever to remain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  See the bright banner a new Day outflings;<br />
  It shall be ours to hold it high and white.<br />
  Again a Voice!  And out of dawning light<br />
  The deathless soul of Joan through us sings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Spirit of Life, radiant and glad and free,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, as of old, be born again of me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through me recover that which man has lost,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine was the making, mine the precious cost.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of my body come the sons of men,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my keeping give their souls again,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me make this world God's little room<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein Love's splendours live again and bloom.</i><br />

  CHRISTMAS SONG
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>To You&mdash;Beloved&mdash;in the Trenches</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
  Christmas!  Is it merry?<br />
  "Smokes and bully-beef!"<br />
  Not one blood-red berry<br />
  Not one holly-leaf.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Stockings filled with pleasure<br />
  That a day destroys&mdash;<br />
  Boxes crammed with treasure<br />
  Ah!  Trench-children's toys!<br />
</p>

<p>
  "Things" that in the passing<br />
  Bring a ray of light,<br />
  "Joy!" with death amassing<br />
  All this Christmas night.<br />
</p>

<p>
  "Stories!"  Yes! and "Laughter!"<br />
  And the heart held high;<br />
  Silence following after<br />
  And the soul's still cry.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Yet another feast day<br />
  In the mud of France&mdash;<br />
  "Hearts," we can at least say,<br />
  "Onward goes the dance."<br />
</p>

<p>
  "There is no cessation<br />
  To this small affair,<br />
  On with war's vocation<br />
  In the hell-fire's flare."<br />
</p>

<p>
  * * * *<br />
</p>

<p>
  It is true as spoken<br />
  With the one word more:<br />
  We have found a token<br />
  By hell's open door.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Through Death's crimson gateway<br />
  We have seen a sign<br />
  That has made this Birthday<br />
  Still a night divine.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Through the first sweet silence,<br />
  Darkness, close and near,<br />
  Has disarmed hell's violence&mdash;<br />
  Night has whispered clear.<br />
</p>

<p>
  "Though all Earth be broken<br />
  Two things live above,<br />
  These&mdash;God's ancient token&mdash;<br />
  Quiet stars&mdash;and Love.<br />
</p>

<p>
  "Stars for life's last reaping,<br />
  Stars in heaven's bright dome,<br />
  Love for your safe keeping<br />
  Love to lead you home."<br />

  LONDON<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>A Canadian soldier, returned to "Blighty" speaks</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
  The day we came to London!  Oh, how strange<br />
  To see the City-of-the-World like this!<br />
  Our dreams had been of London.  Not 'the sights'<br />
  But that young London that young hearts explore;<br />
  The Music Halls, the roads, the sleepy Inns,<br />
  Where old Romance is felt anew each day.<br />
  This was to be our London.<br />
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we came:<br />
  We came as cattle come, when packed too tight<br />
  In some barbaric car of ancient mould;<br />
  We came not driven with whips, nor massed in crowds,<br />
  But driven by bitter pain and almost dead<br />
  From faintness of our wounds.  We came<br />
  From siege and rapine, plunder and hell-fire,<br />
  From thunders never ceasing, from swift death,<br />
  From screams and cries, and parting gasp of souls,<br />
  And from supremest vision given to man.<br />
  This way we came to London.<br />
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my friends,<br />
  We touched white cliffs upon a summer day,<br />
  Pain-blinded, minds befogged, we rode along<br />
  That ancient-traversed way of all the world.<br />
  And, slowly, as the evening shadows fell<br />
  We reached old Paddington.  Were driven out<br />
  In shabby cabs, through misty, half-lit ways,<br />
  Into a great wide Place, from whence small streets<br />
  Wondered zig-zag with no apparent plan,<br />
  <i>Yet knew we were at home.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still can feel<br />
  The cab stop for a moment, and a face<br />
  Peer in the open window.  'Twas a mask<br />
  Set in a flowered hat.  With awful eyes<br />
  She stared, and asked, and answered in a flash:<br />
  "Ah, well!  You're nearly dead, poor dears, but I&mdash;<br />
  I, who am here forever, come again."<br />
</p>

<p>
  And then we drifted on, and soft grey walls<br />
  Held us a moment to dissolve in mist.<br />
  Once at a turn I saw the Abbey rise<br />
  And once the outstretched arms of giant trees.<br />
  Sometimes a light, but always murmurous noise<br />
  Not so much hoof-beat, motor-hum or cry,<br />
  As vibrancy of voices, far and near,<br />
  A myriad-mingled sound of many men.<br />
  This, and a strange new vision of the heart,<br />
  A love just dawning, an age-old surprise,<br />
  A sudden turning to those splendid arms<br />
  That are forever open.  Thus we came<br />
  Broken by war, home to her splendid arms.<br />
</p>
